          Look for:
          - One process saturating a single core
          - Many processes competing for CPU
          - Misbehaving background services
          High CPU usage is usually a software issue,
          not a governor or kernel problem.

      - description: >
          schedutil is the modern default on Arch Linux.
          It integrates directly with the kernel scheduler.
          ✔ Good balance of performance and power  
          ✔ Recommended for most users

          Focus on:
          - Adequate cooling
          - Correct governor selection
          - Background workloads
          Power tools may reduce performance without real benefit.
  scaling_intro:

          If frequencies scale normally,

          Key takeaways:
          - Identify software load before tuning
          - schedutil is best for most users
          - Use only one power management tool
          - Avoid premature optimization
