      pacman is strict by design.
      Errors usually mean something is out of sync or unsafe.
      What error are you encountering?
    options:
      k: "Invalid or corrupted keyring"

  keyring_invalid:
    question: >
      Keyring errors usually occur when the system
      has not been updated for a long time.
      Has this system been unused for weeks or months?
