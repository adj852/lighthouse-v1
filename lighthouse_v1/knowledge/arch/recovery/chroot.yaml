          Before chrooting, mount the target system properly:
          1. Mount the root filesystem to /mnt
          2. Mount /boot or /efi if used
          3. For UEFI systems, mount the EFI System Partition
          Incorrect mounts will cause bootloader installation to fail.

          Most unbootable systems are recoverable this way.

          chroot is a recovery tool, not a workaround.
